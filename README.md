# Turtle Racing Game
This is a simple Turtle Racing game created using Python's turtle module. In this game, multiple turtle-shaped racers compete in a race, and the player is prompted to choose how many racers will participate. The first turtle to reach the finish line wins!

# Features:
1. Choose between 2 to 10 racers.
2. Randomized racer colors from a preset list.
3. The race progresses with each turtle moving randomly, making the outcome unpredictable and exciting.

# Prerequisites:
1. Python: You need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it here.
2. Turtle Module: The turtle module comes pre-installed with Python, so no additional libraries are needed.

# How to Play:
1. Clone/Download the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/Hamadabcn/turtleRace.git
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the game using: py main.py
4. The game will prompt you to enter the number of racers (between 2 and 10).
5. The race will begin, and the turtles will start moving.
6. The winner will be displayed once the race is over.

# Controls:
No additional controls are required; the game proceeds automatically after the number of racers is chosen.

# Enjoy the Game!
Feel free to modify or extend the code to add new features or change the gameplay!
